I am sorry, I have not completed the entire test. I encountered a bug when connecting to Google Sheets. 
I try my best, from 9 am to 5 pm, but I just can't connect to the Google sheet which you shared with me use Node.js. 
In order to complete the test as much as possible, I give up write title and username to Google sheet, 
and write them to /NodejsTest/result.json
