# The python test in the PythonTest

# The Node.js test in the NodejsTest

*********************************************************************************************************************
I am sorry, I have not completed the entire test. I encountered a bug when connecting to Google Sheets. 
I try my best, from 9 am to 5 pm, but I just can't connect to the Google sheet which you shared with me use Node.js. 
In order to complete the test as much as possible, I give up write title and username to Google sheet, 
and write them to /NodejsTest/result.json and deploy it at alicloud.

## The Node.js test has deploy in alicloud: http://47.97.230.218:8080/v1/log

## You must send the POST request with json like:  {"ablum_list": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]}
