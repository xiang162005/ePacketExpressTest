# The python test in the /PythonTest

test a and test b result: **name_count.csv**

test c result: **origin_count.csv**

test a and test b code: **test_ab.py**

test c code: **test_c.py**(For dodge IP blockade, I make 10-20 seconds timeout between each search, 
                           so it may takes 20-30 minutes to finish search)
