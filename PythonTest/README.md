# The python test:

test A and test B result: **name_count.csv**

test C result: **origin_count.csv**

test A and test B code: **test_ab.py**

test C code: **test_c.py**(For dodge IP blockade, I make 10-20 seconds timeout between each search, 
                           so it may takes 20-30 minutes to finish search)
