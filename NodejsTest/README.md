# The Node.js test:

the title and username are in **result.json**

my main codes are in **setup.js** and **/routes/main.js**

**/routes/post.js** is what I test send a list of numbers as album ID in json 

**/routes/google_sheet.js** and **/routes/google_sheet2.js** are two ways I try to connect Google sheet, but failed.
